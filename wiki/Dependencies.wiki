= Dependencies =

Ocrivist makes use of a number of Linux libraries and other programs. Many of these are installed by default on most Linux distributions, some may be installed using the distribution's package manager and a few will need to be either downloaded from the Ocrivist Project's Downloads section or compiled to suit the distribution you are using and the libraries available on it.

=== libtiff.so.4 ===

*libtiff* can usually be installed using your package manager. If you need to compile liblept or libocrivist for your system, make sure that the *libtiff development* package is also installed (libtiff4-dev on Debian-based systems, libtiff-devel on RPM-based systems)
----
 
===liblept.so.2===
*liblept.so.2* is required by both the ocrivist program and by libocrivist. It can be compiled and installed after downloading [http://code.google.com/p/leptonica/downloads/detail?name=leptonica-1.68.tar.gz leptonica v.1.68] from the [http://code.google.com/p/leptonica/ Leptonica Project]. See [Dependencies#Compiling_and_installing_libraries below] for guidance on compiling.
----
===libocrivist.so.3===
*libocrivist.so.3* is derived from v.3.00 of [http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/ Tesseract-ocr]. It can be downloaded from the [http://code.google.com/p/ocrivist/downloads/detail?name=libocrivist-3.00r4.tar.gz Ocrivist] downloads section, compiled and installed. See [Dependencies#Compiling_and_installing_libraries below] for guidance on compiling.
----
===libsane.so.1===
*libsane.so.1* is installed by default on most distributions.
----
===libaspell.so.15===
*libaspell.so.15* is often installed by default and should be available in your distribution repository
----
===Djvulibre===
The *djvulibre* suite provides a number of programs used for manipulating and creating _djvu_ format files. It is usually available from your distribution repositories or from [http://djvu.sourceforge.net/ Sourceforge].

The *djvulibre* programs are _not_ essential for Ocrivist to run, but without them it will not be possible to export Ocrivist projects to DjVu format.

==Compiling and installing libraries===
*Important:* both liblept and libocrivist will compile without libtiff but the ocrivist program will not work correctly if this happens. Most Linux distributions install libtiff by default but the *development* package also needs to be installed before attempting to compile a program or library that links to libtiff.


To compile and install *liblept*, first ensure that the libtiff development files are installed, then  download [http://code.google.com/p/leptonica/downloads/detail?name=leptonica-1.68.tar.gz leptonica v.1.68] and extract all the files to a convenient location. Using a terminal console, *cd* into the *leptonica* folder and enter 

{{{./configure}}}

If no errors occur you should eventually get a message telling you that you can now compile the package by typing 

{{{make}}} 

If all goes well you can then then use root privileges (*su* or *sudo*)  and install the library by typing 

{{{make install}}} 

*libocrivist* is compiled and installed using the same procedure.

Note that *liblept* and *libtiff* must be installed before you attempt to compile *libocrivist*
